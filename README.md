Battleship
==========

This was a school project at the High School in Stockerau (Austria) in a different programming language and was ported and expanded by me for my graduation. Currently it is under construction and it is only a beta. It will be expanded in the future by a few features.

Left you have your own field, where you have to find the ships. On the right side there is the second field for the computer. Before you start the game with the "Start game" button, you can move the ships in the right field (If it is activated in the settings).

There are:
- 1 red ship (5 or 4 fields)
- 2 green ships (each with 4 or 3 fields)
- 3 yellow boats (each with 3 or 2 fields)
- 4 purple ships (each with 2 or 1 field)
In the settings you can choose between these two variations of the ships size.

The game is played with the normal rules -> To every ship around, there is only water, the ships can't collide, diagonal too.

All colors in this game are the Android Holo UI colors.

The permissions are needed for the following features:
- INTERNET: Google Analytics (Opt-out possible) and In-App purchase
- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: Google Analytics (Opt-out possible) and In-App purchase
- BILLING: IN-App purchase
